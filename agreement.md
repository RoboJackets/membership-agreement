## School of Mechanical Engineering Instructional Labs and Fabrication Space User Agreement

Any persons wishing to use equipment or perform tasks in the Student Competition Center ("SCC") must agree to this User
Agreement.

### Professional conduct is required

- Training is required to use any piece of equipment in the SCC.
- Horseplay is never appropriate in any of the SCC spaces.
- Be aware of others around your work and the work being performed around you at all times.
- Use the correct tool for the job and never abuse the tool. Use the training you have received.
- Do not hold your workpieces with your hands when using cutting tools. Clamp your workpiece in a vice and use two
hands to hold the tool whenever possible.
- Know your physical limits. Do not operate power tools when you are too tired to be alert.
- Always report any injury, broken tool, housekeeping issue, or potential hazard.

### Dress for the work being performed

- You must wear personal protection equipment (safety glasses, earplugs, breathing masks, etc.) anywhere signs are
posted in the SCC or whenever appropriate based on good training for that tool. For example, you must wear safety
glasses whenever powered, sharp, or impact tools are being used in your vicinity.
- Never approach rotating or large power tools with loose clothing, long untied hair, lanyards, headphone cords around
your neck, or large jewelry that could pull you toward the machine.
- Shoes worn in the fabrication spaces must cover the tops of your feet.

### Public health measures

- Face masks are required per Georgia Tech policy.
- In the CMA and when operating any power tool, face masks must loop around the ears and remove easily. No ear savers
and no behind-the-head loops.
- After using hand sanitizer, hands must be completely dry before using any equipment. Hand sanitizer contains alcohol
and is highly flammable!
- Remain 6 feet from all other persons as much as possible.

### The buddy system applies whenever you're using powered tools

- Work with at least one person within voice and visual distance of you when working in fabrication spaces.
- A closed door must not separate you from your buddy.
- Your work buddy must be trained and able to turn off the tool in the event of an emergency.
- Your buddy must be able to call Georgia Tech Police (404-894-2500) in an emergency.
- The user must confirm the above four requirements are met any time powered tools are in operation.

### Help keep the SCC safe

- Clean your work area of any debris that you have created or others have created before you. The next person using the
space must find it to be clean, organized, and safe.
- Help keep the floors dry and free of tripping or slipping hazards such as sawdust, oil, electrical cords, or raw
materials.
- Whenever you use a tool, you are responsible for returning it to its proper storage location, regardless of where you
found it. If you are unsure, please ask your team leadership.
- Exits and walkways must be kept clear of furniture or workpieces for safe passage during an emergency.
- Never modify any tool, and especially, never remove safety devices from tools.
- If you see someone working in an unsafe manner, you must gently correct them as a colleague. If you feel uncomfortable
with such, please contact your team leadership or Dr. Cunefare and inform them of the situation.

## Student Competition Center Facility Rules

1. You, and all members of Student Competition Center ("SCC") teams, are assumed to be in control of your faculties and
will be held responsible for your actions and your enablement of other's actions around you, including guests. Every
safety precaution must be followed appropriate to the situation at hand, even if it is not included on this list.
Horsing around will not be tolerated. Working alone in any fabrication space is generally prohibited unless such work is
inherently non-hazardous.
2. You must log all use of machine tools through the provided means before every use. You must have a "buddy" in the
immediate area capable of and trained to safely shut down any power equipment you might be using. At least one other
person must be within talking distance when any powered, sharp, or impact tools are being used. No logged-in machine
may be left unattended at any time.
3. Active use of the Common Machining Area and active noise-generating fabrication activities in team spaces should not
occur during announced "cold shop" events, such as sponsor visits to the SCC. Such activities may resume after the end
of the scheduled visit, even if the sponsor is still present. You must apply all safety precautions with sponsors if
they enter active work areas.
4. Safety glasses are to be worn by everyone in the work area anytime that powered, sharp, or impact tools are being
used. Respirators must be worn while cutting, sanding, or painting with materials prone to cause lung damage. You must
wear ear protection during times when the noise level is especially high or prolonged.
5. Sandals, or other open toe shoes, are not allowed on the work floor of the shop at any time. You may wear sandals
while working in the offices and on a reasonable path from the door to the offices only.
6. Flammables must be in sealed, correctly labeled containers and inside a marked flammables cabinet. Containers capable
of holding more than 1 gallon of fuel must be stored in the flammables out-building when not being used to fill a
vehicle. Leaking flammables (e.g., from vehicle fuel systems) must be corrected immediately upon detection. Appropriate
fire extinguishers must be immediately available whenever flammables are being handled. At least one other person must
be within talking distance when any chemicals or flammables are being used.
7. Machine tools are to be used properly by trained individuals. Leaving the machine clean is a part of using the
machine properly. Any malfunction or damage to the machines that renders them unsafe for continued use must be marked
"DOWN" in the Shared User Management System ("SUMS") and immediately reported by email to [scc@me.gatech.edu][sccrt].
If a malfunction occurs, but the machine can still be used safely (for example, if the probe is damaged on the Haas), do
not mark it "DOWN" but report it by email to [scc@me.gatech.edu][sccrt].
8. All participants have the responsibility to keep both the common areas and the teams' areas clean so that the school
will not be embarrassed by bringing campus visitors into the building at any time. This includes the days just before a
competition and any time that the team is not fully active such as during summer break. You may not leave beverage
cans, food boxes, oily rags, and other general garbage around any area of the building, including inside the individual
teams' work areas or offices. Exterior spaces must be kept cleaned and organized as well.
9. Wood, body filler, paint, and composites should not be cut or sanded inside the Student Competition Center building
without environmental control. These activities should be done outside the building or in spaces prepared for dust
containment.
10. Spray-painting should be done outside the building without marking any surface.
11. All waste fluids must be disposed of properly, in proper containers, following EH&S approved disposal practices. All
waste fluids disposed of at the SCC must be generated by official SCC related activities.
12. Only water and hand cleansers may be used in the sinks. If it's not water, don't put it down a drain.
13. The conference room is to be used for discussions, planning, computer modeling, metrology, and vinyl-graphics
cutting. It is not for fabrication of components of any kind, nor is it a storage area for any team.
14. The horizontal surface over the entrance hallway is not to be used for storage. The un-fenced areas on the mezzanine
must remain clear at all times.
15. Personal or classroom projects must not be a distraction or take up space in any common area of the shop or the
parking or drive areas outside the shop without (rarely granted) permission. Personal projects must not make any
significant use of team or SCC consumable resources.
16. Anytime a vehicle is parked in front of the roll-up door, the keys must be inside the building with someone who has
permission to move the vehicle at a moment's notice. Contact information for that individual must be prominently
visible through the windshield.

Infractions of these rules may lead to individual and/or team sanctions, up to and including expulsion from the SCC.

If you need clarification on any of these rules, please contact [scc@me.gatech.edu][sccrt].
