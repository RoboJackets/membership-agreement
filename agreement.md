## GWW Instructional Labs and Fabrication Space User’s Agreement

Any persons wishing to use equipment or perform tasks in the SCC must agree to this User Agreement.

### Professional Conduct is required

- Training is required to use any piece of equipment in the SCC.
- Horseplay is never appropriate in any of the SCC spaces.
- Be aware of others around your work, and the work being performed around you, at all times.
- Use the correct tool for the job and never abuse the tool. Use the training you have received.
- Do not hold your work pieces with your hands when using cutting tools. Clamp your work piece in a vice and use two
hands to hold the tool whenever possible.
- Know your physical limits. Do not operate power tools when you are too tired to be alert.
- Always report any injury, broken tool, housekeeping issue, or potential hazard.

### Dress for the work being performed

- Personal protection equipment (safety glasses, ear plugs, breathing masks, etc) are to be worn anywhere signs are
posted in the SCC, or whenever appropriate based on good training for that tool. For example, safety glasses are to be
worn anytime powered, sharp, or impact tools are being used in your vicinity.
- Never approach rotating or any large power tools with loose clothing, long untied hair, lanyards, headphone cords
around your neck, or large jewelry that could pull you toward the machine.
- Shoes worn in the fabrication spaces must cover the tops of your feet.

### Covid-19

- Face masks are required per Georgia Tech policy.
- In the CMA and when operating any power tool, face masks must loop around the ears and remove easily. No ear savers,
and no behind-the-head loops.
- After using hand sanitizer, hands must be completely dry before using any equipment. Hand sanitizer contains alcohol
and is highly flammable!
- Remain 6 feet from all other persons as much as possible.

### The Buddy System applies whenever you’re using powered tools anywhere in the SCC

- Work with at least one person within voice and visual distance of you when working in fabrication spaces
- You must not be separated by a closed door from your buddy.
- Your work buddy must be trained (and able) to turn off the tool in the event of an emergency.
- Your buddy must be able to call the campus police (404) 894-2500 in any emergency.
- It is the user’s responsibility to confirm the above four requirements are met any time powered tools are in
operation.

### Help Keep the Fabrication Labs Safe as You Use Them

- Clean your work area of any debris that you have created or others have created before you. The next person using
the space must find it to be clean, organized, and safe.
- Help keep the floors dry and free of tripping or slipping hazards such as saw dust, oil, electrical cords, or raw
materials.
- Whenever you use a tool, you are responsible for returning it to its proper storage location, regardless of where you
found it. If you are unsure, please ask your team leadership.
- Exits and walkways must be kept clear of furniture or work pieces for safe passage during an emergency.
- Never modify any tool, and especially, never remove safety devices from tools.
- If you see someone working in an unsafe manner, you must gently correct them as a colleague; if you feel
uncomfortable with such, please contact your team leadership or Dr. Cunefare, and inform them of the situation.

SCC Rev 8/24/2020

## 14th Street Student Competition Center Rules rev3 1/29/2019

1. You, and all members of Student Competition Center teams, are assumed to be in control of your faculties and will be
held responsible for your actions and your enablement of other's actions around you including guests. Every safety
precaution must be followed appropriate to the situation at hand even if it is not included on this list. Horsing around
will not be tolerated. Working alone in any fabrication space is generally prohibited, unless such work is inherently
non-hazardous.
2. All use of machine tools must be logged through the provided means prior to every use. You must have a “buddy” in
the immediate area capable of and trained to safely shut down any power equipment you might be using. At least one
other person must be within talking distance when any powered, sharp, or impact tools are being used. No logged-in
machine may be left unattended at any time.
3. Active use of the Common Machining Area, and active noise-generating fabrication activities in team spaces, should
not occur during announced “Cold Shop” events, such as sponsor visits to the SCC. Such activities may resume after
the end of the scheduled visit, even if the sponsor is still present. All safety precautions must be applied with
sponsors if they enter active work areas.
4. Safety glasses are to be worn by everyone in the work area anytime that powered, sharp, or impact tools are being
used. Respirators must be worn while cutting, sanding, or painting with materials prone to cause lung damage. Ear
protection must be worn during times when the noise level is especially high or prolonged.
5. Sandals, or other open toe shoes, are not allowed on the work floor of the shop at any time. Sandals may be worn
while working in the offices and on a reasonable path from the door to the offices only.
6. Flammables must be in sealed, correctly labeled containers and inside a marked flammables cabinet. Containers
capable of holding in excess of 1 gallon of fuel must be stored in the flammables out-building when not being used to
fill a vehicle. Leaking flammables (e.g., from vehicle fuel systems) must be corrected immediately upon detection.
Appropriate fire extinguishers must be immediately available whenever flammables are being handled. At least one
other person must be within talking distance when any chemicals or flammables are being used.
7. Machine tools are to be used properly by trained individuals. Leaving the machine clean is a part of using the
machine properly. Any malfunctions or damage to the machines that renders them unsafe for continued use must be marked
“DOWN” in SUMS and immediately reported by email to ​ scc@me.gatech.edu​ . If a malfunction occurs but the machine can
still be used safely (for example, if the probe is damaged on the Haas), do not mark it “DOWN” but do report it by
email to ​ scc@me.gatech.edu​ .
8. All participants have the responsibility to keep both the common areas and the teams’ areas clean so that the school
will not be embarrassed by bringing campus visitors into the building at any time. This includes the days just before a
competition and anytime that the team is not fully active such as during summer break. Beverage cans, food boxes, oily
rags, and other general garbage may not be left around any area of the building including inside the individual
teams’ work areas or offices. Exterior spaces must be kept cleaned and organized, as well.
9. Wood, body filler, paint, and composites should not be cut or sanded inside the Student Competition Center building
without environmental control. These activities should be done outside the building or in spaces prepared for dust
containment.
10. Spray-painting should be done outside the building (without marking any surface).
11. All waste fluids must be disposed of properly, in proper containers, following EH&S approved disposal practices. All
waste fluids disposed of at the SCC must be generated by official SCC related activities.
12. Only water and hand cleansers may be used in the sinks. If it’s not water, don’t put it down a drain.
13. The conference room is to be used for discussions, planning, computer modeling, metrology, and vinyl-graphics
cutting. The conference room is not for fabrication of components of any kind, and is not a storage area for any team.
14. The horizontal surface over the entrance hallway is not to be used for storage. The un-fenced areas on the mezzanine
are to remain clear at all times.
15. Personal or classroom projects must not be a distraction or take up space in any common area of the shop or in the
parking or drive areas outside the shop without (rarely granted) permission. Personal projects must not make any
significant use of team or SCC consumable resources.
16. Anytime a vehicle is parked in front of the roll-up door, the keys must be inside the building with someone who has
permission to move the vehicle at a moment's notice, and contact information for that individual must be prominently
visible through the windshield.

Infractions of these rules may lead to individual and/or team sanctions, up to expulsion from the SCC.

If you need clarification on any of these rules, please contact Jason Barnes: 404-385-3790 scc@me.gatech.edu
